During my Data Science Internship at Reesby Recruitment, I worked on large datasets containing more than 7,000 company records. My responsibilities focused on improving the quality and completeness of the data before it was used by the business.

Key Tasks & Responsibilities

Cleaned and organised raw datasets to ensure data accuracy and consistency.

Applied Excel functions such as VLOOKUP, INDEX-MATCH, Pivot Tables, and Conditional Formatting to search, match, validate and standardise data.

Manually researched missing or outdated company information through online sources (company websites, LinkedIn, ABN search, etc.) to verify records.

Entered updated information into the database to maintain a complete, structured and reliable dataset.

Tools Used

Microsoft Excel

Online research tools

Internal company database

Outcome

This project improved the integrity of the dataset and enabled internal stakeholders to access consistent and accurate company information for business decision-making.
